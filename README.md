Awesome projects to do with off-the-shelf hardware

Sometimes I get asked if I accept donations for my projects (one project specifically, yanderify. I don't, and I don't plan to).
Sometimes, people want to help in other ways.
Or, maybe you've come here because you just found this repository and don't know at all what I'm talking about.
Regardless, here is a list of projects that I approve of, and that are easier to contribute to than my projects in most cases.

## Projects that don't require a beefy computer
- [Preserve our digital heritage!](https://www.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=ArchiveTeam_Warrior) (requires some technical experience)
- [Run a Tor exit node](https://blog.torproject.org/tips-running-exit-node) (somewhat risky and controversial; requires technical experience).

## Projects that require a good computer, but do not use a graphics card
These projects run well on servers and on older desktops.

- [Simulate proteins and cure diseases!](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/) Rosetta@Home has had tangible results, and they are doing work on COVID-19. This is one of my favorites.

## Projects that use a graphics cards, although a card is not required
These projects run well on desktops that are good at playing games or rendering video.
However, most of these projects can run without a graphics card.

- [Search for aliens!](https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/) (currently in hibernation)
- [Simulate proteins and cure diseases, again!](https://foldingathome.org/) This is similar to Rosetta@Home but works on graphics cards.
- [Find the tallest cactus!](https://minecraftathome.com/minecrafthome/) Well, they already have found it. Tallest cactus in Minecraft, mind you.

## Projects that can't be contributed to with a computer, but are interesting nonetheless
- [Sci-Hub puts knowledge in the hands of everyone.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub) While generally frowned upon by publishers and academic journals, it's likely had a positive impact on all of us in one way or another.
